## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Brackets.io Code Editor
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learnt how positioning affects z-index. I also finally got to practice CSS grid.


```css
main {
  display: grid;
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I will continue focuing in on future projects
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-First Workflow


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7tLPhnA06w) - This helped me for better understanding on CSS GRID. I really liked this pattern of teaching and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
